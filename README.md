# Spotify tags

My own web application designed to help me tag, organize, and search Spotify tracks efficiently. 

Built with Next.js on the frontend and AWS SAM on the backend.

It allows me to:

* **Tagging**: Add, remove or edits tag for my Spotify tracks.
* **Search**: Effortlessly searching through my tracks and tags to find exactly what I need.
* **Play**: I can play preview the tracks right there on the web app.
* **Spotify UI**: UI similar to official Spotify web player for intuitive UX.


**I have also setup an IOS shortcut on my mobile which prompt me to type some tags then it's picks up my spotify tracks and call my backend to save them.**
